                What we are looking for

                As a fully digital bank, we are looking for engineers that are able to understand and prioritise security when implementing new features, fixing bugs or making technical improvements, across all the layers. Our team is designing, building and releasing new screens every day, for this reason we are interested in people with a particular focus on Accessibility along with writing clean and maintainable code.

                The way to thrive and shine within Starling is to be a self-driven individual and be able to take full ownership of everything around you: From building the code, shipping and maintaining it, to sharing knowledge with your colleagues and making sure all processes are efficient and productive to deliver the best possible results for our customers.

                Our aim is to deliver stable, resilient and high quality code, that is why testing is another key quality we look for when expanding our team. We useEspressoto write our UI/E2E Test andJUnitto write our Unit Tests across all layers of the application, as well as manually test all features before they go into production. We also work closely with QA engineers to ensure we have an additional level of testing when working on complex feature delivery.

                All Starling engineers work in a hybrid pattern both from home and one of our offices. Our preference is that youâ€™re located within a commutable distance to either our London, Manchester, Southampton or Cardiff office, so that weâ€™re able to see each other and collaborate in person too.
